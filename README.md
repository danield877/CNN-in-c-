# Convolutional Neural Network 
In this repository, a convolutional neural network is programmed from 0 to classify images.
It was tested with the MNIST image dataset for the classification of numbers from 0 to 9 handwritten.
There are two ways to run the code:
* Compiling it with CMake and executing the file example_MNIST.exe in the Build folder created.
* Ejecutando el archivo example_MNIST.exe en la carpeta 'VSC easy'
